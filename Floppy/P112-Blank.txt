This image is a blank meaning there are no files on it.  However, it does have the 128 byte FPB header
required by CPU280 for access.  To make a blank disk, you must first format it as a standard DOS 1.44MB
floppy, then write this blank image file onto it.

2017-02-28:

Added volume label "CPU280" and activation of date/time stamping.
